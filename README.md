# Simple Data Visualization
This repo performs a simple analysis on housing data in Lagos and Abuja
This project is divided into two parts as follows:
- Web Scraping: this is done to acquire the needed data (houses,location,rooms,prices,etc.) from a property agency (NigeriaProperty.com was used for this).
BeautifulSoup and the Selenium frameworks is used for the purpose of this scraping. The data acquired is then stored in a csv file.
- Data Visualization: the csv file is loaded using pandas. Pandas was also used for the data cleaning and Matplotlib is used for the data visualization.
